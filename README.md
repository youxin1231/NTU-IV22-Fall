## NTU-IV22-Fall

#### National Taiwan University CSIE Introduction to Intelligent Vehicles Homework in 2022 Fall

#### HW1:

##### Given n number of messages, tau, transmission time C and the period T in the 'input.dat'. Find the worst-case response time of each messages based on timing analysis of the CAN protocol.

#### HW2:

##### Given n number of messages, tau, transmission time C and the period T in the 'input.dat'. Decide the priority of messages by Simulated Annealing  that minimize the summation of the worst-case response time of all messages.

#### Final Project: A survey of modern 3D depth sensors.
